# kay-decnum

Kay language - arbitrary precision decimal number library and examples.

The decNumber functionality is linked by my Kay compiler as part of its standard library.
The library is written in C and is available here: http://speleotrove.com
The documentation is available here: http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumber.pdf

I did not want to or plan to implement FPU instruction set support any time soon so this library comes in handy.
